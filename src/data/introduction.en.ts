		"While building my career primarily through SI projects, I never settled for simply implementing requirements. Even when legacy code would have sufficed, I chose [metric]better architecture and modern approaches[/metric], proactively raising the bar. I always prioritize the user experience first, value maintainability and scalability in design and code quality, and consistently practice building reusable common components and improving code structure.",
		"I've been told countless times that [metric]'you should be building solutions.'[/metric] Even in SI project environments, I see myself as a 'solution-building developer,' constantly placing myself in challenging situations to grow practical development skills. The patience and [metric]confidence that I can tackle anything[/metric] gained through this process are my greatest strengths.",
		"Through building a modern architecture based on Vue 3 + PrimeVue in an air-gapped environment and leading 4 junior developers while designing a design system and common modules, I've developed [metric]technical leadership[/metric] and [metric]system design capabilities[/metric]. After work, I continue expanding my modern frontend expertise through side projects (React 19, Zustand, Vite, Vercel).",
		"Whether it's new technology or a new environment, I love adapting quickly and diving deep. I enjoy this work so much that nothing else compares, and I want to work in an environment where I can blend these technologies into the team and product.",
